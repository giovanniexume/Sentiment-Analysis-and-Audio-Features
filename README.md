This is a personal project I did on three of my favorite artists. 
Used basic web-scrapping packages spotifyr and academictwitteR to pull audio feature data from Spotify and tweet data from Twitter. 
Cleaned and analyzed in R. 
Descriptive dashboard built in Tableau, giving an overall picture of sentiment and musical properties.
