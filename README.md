This is a personal project I did on three top Spotify artists. 
Used basic web-scraping packages spotifyr and academictwitteR to pull audio feature data from Spotify and tweet data from Twitter. 
Cleaned and analyzed in R. 
Descriptive dashboard built in Tableau, giving an overall picture of sentiment and musical properties.
